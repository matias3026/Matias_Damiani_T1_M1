                team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

                    the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                    minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                    assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                    whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                    from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
